Created four API endpoints along with MongoDB for storing data
1. Create endpoint
   (a) Takes name, img, summary as input from body
   (b) creates a document in collection
2. Read ednpoint
   (a) read all the entries in the collection
3. Update endooint
   (a) takes the object id as query parameter for recognizing entry
   (b) update the entries with the parameters given by the user
5. Delete endpoint
   (a) Takes id of entry as query parameter
   (b) removes that document with given id from the collection.
